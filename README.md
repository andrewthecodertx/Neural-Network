# FEED FORWARD NEURAL NETWORK

There is a comma separated values file included. It is data on red wines.
This is my initial training data. The idea is for this network to be dynamic!
It will take in your data and adjust before it begins training.

The math isn't there yet. This is just the initial setup. Take in the input,
setup weights and biases. At the moment, there are 4 hidden layers with 4
neurons each, but by the end this will also be determined by the user.

I would like to Dockerize this for people who don't want to deal with building
a Go application, but that is low on the priority list. However, if YOU want
to jump in and help make this more user friendly, PR are welcome and
encouraged.
